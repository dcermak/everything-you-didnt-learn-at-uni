* All the Things they didn't teach you at University

This repository contains the slides for the presentation "Everything that they
did not teach you at University" held at DevConf.cz 2023 and as "(Fast) alles
was man an der Uni nicht lernt" at the [[https://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2024/de/programm/beitrag/322][Chemnitzer Linux Tage 2024]].

You can find the rendered slides here:

** Building the slides

You can create the html slides yourself from within Emacs by opening the
[[./everything-you-didnt-learn-at-uni.org]] file, launching =org-mode= and executing
~(require 'ox-reveal)~ (you might have to install =ox-reveal= beforehand). Then
export the org file to reveal.js (this is by default bound to the keychord =C-c
C-e R R=).

If you are not a Emacs user, then just install Emacs and execute:
#+begin_src bash
emacs everything-you-didnt-learn-at-uni.org -Q --batch -l export-init.el -f org-reveal-export-to-html --kill
#+end_src
