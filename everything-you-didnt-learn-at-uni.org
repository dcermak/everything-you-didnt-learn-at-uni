…this will all change…

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) :frag_idx 8
but one thing will *never* change

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) :frag_idx 9
you have to deal with *people*


* Working with people

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- their motivation \neq your motivation
- their employer \ne your employer
- their culture \ne your culture
- volunteers, paid contributors, students, etc.


** Motivations for contributing
#+begin_notes
Reciprocity – duty to give back
Kinship - do it for the community
Own-Use - scratch your own itch

why think about this? \Rightarrow helps understand contributors & "lever to make them do
things"

motivations from https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10291, "fun facts":
- women ~3x more likely out of reciprocity
- coders 4x more likely for fun
- experienced much more likely out of altruism & ideology than non-experienced

change over time:
- own use & ideology \downarrow
- Fun, Kinship, Reciprocity \uparrow (double)
#+end_notes

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. Ideology
2. Altruism
3. Fun
4. Kinship
5. Reputation
6. Reciprocity
7. Learning
8. Own-Use
9. Career
10. Pay


** How to communicate
#+begin_notes
- keep backgrounds of others in mind
- assume best intentions
#+end_notes

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- asynchronous: @@html: <i class="fa-regular fa-envelope"></i> email, <i class="fa-brands fa-discourse"></i> forums@@
- synchronous: @@html: <i class="fa-regular fa-comments"></i> chat, <i class="fa-regular fa-headset"></i> voice/video chat@@
- issue/bug/feature tracker(s)

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
avoid ambiguities!

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
#+begin_quote
Yeah, right
#+end_quote

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- keep it simple
- be kind to each other

* What it means to be a Maintainer

#+begin_notes
- infra: mailinglist/forum, CI, website
#+end_notes

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- you will have to learn to let go & share responsibilities
- take care of all the "boring" parts:
  - infra
  - documentation
  - onboarding & mentoring
  - issue triage & patch reviews
  - funding
  - moderation
- licenses/legal
- project & release management


** How to make your project popular

#+begin_notes
- become the marketing person
- be friendly & welcoming
- be firm in your decisions
#+end_notes

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- build something that people truly need/want
- marketing: talks, tutorials, evangelizing
- documentation, documentation, documentation

** The Contributor Funnel

#+begin_notes
- from Mike McQuaid
- generally how people become maintainers/contributors:
  user \rightarrow contributor \rightarrow maintainer
- more contributors? \Rightarrow get more users!
#+end_notes

@@html:<img src="./media/contributor_funnel.svg"></img>@@


** Recruiting contributors
#+begin_notes
- [[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hsJLv1ieSqtXBzd5YZusY-mB8e1VJzaeOmh8Q4VeMio/][study by Mozilla]] about engagement in the community
- you *must* give contributors a vision \rightarrow they'll return even if the past wasn't great
  \rightarrow have features/roadmaps ready, encourage ideas, etc
- onboarding different: past experience highly motivating
#+end_notes
@@html:<img src="./media/mozilla_impact_study.png"></img>@@

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- past impact does *not* matter, perceived future impact *does*
- contributors need a vision
- good onboarding experience encourages further onboarding


#+REVEAL: split

#+begin_notes
- respond within 48h to PR \Rightarrow very high likelihood of returning
- respond later than 7d \Rightarrow you are not seeing them ever again
#+end_notes

@@html:<img src="./media/mozilla_days_to_first_contribution.png" height="350px"/>@@

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- prompt responses boost the chances of a contributor returning
- suggest another issue to work on


** Take care of yourself!

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- stay true to yourself & your motivation
- *you* must stay your top priority


* Community

#+begin_notes
- project should make it clear how to contact it & get it touch
  \Rightarrow landing page, have just very few channels and monitor all of them
  if someone joins, you as the maintainer must be made aware of that
- project must *want* contributions
#+end_notes

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- "just a bunch of people"
- often no clear joining rules


#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- be an enabler and empower your community, don't be a gatekeeper
- embrace diversity

** Build a welcoming community

#+begin_notes
- codes of conduct are not evil,
  but don't just stick the [[https://www.contributor-covenant.org/][contributor covenant]] on your project and be done with it
  \Rightarrow live by the thing

- provide a place for your community to meet & talk
  \rightarrow nurtures the sense of belonging
  \rightarrow helps *you*, as all communication needn't go through you

- documented rules & processes prevent hair splitting:
  - undocumented rules that are just in a "hive-mind" result in contributors getting frustrated
    \Rightarrow they'll leave soon
  - if there is a conflict, then you can point to the rules
  - even better: enforce rules via code

- empower your contributors:
  - if new people show up, let them take simple issues even if you could solve them in 1/10th of the time
  - share ownership of your project
#+end_notes

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- enforce a code of conduct
- provide a place for your community to meet & talk
- document & enforce processes meticulously
- be present and friendly
- empower your contributors

** Keeping the Community motivated

#+begin_notes
- intrinsic motivation: desire to code just for fun/hobby
- altruism, including community identification (satisfy need to belong to group)
- future reward: revenue from selling product, skills, self-marketing, peer recognition
- personal need: scratch your own itch
#+end_notes

Retaining contributors

@@html: <img src="./media/contribution_movement.svg" height="300px"/>@@

# #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
# Keep them motivated!

# #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
# - intrinsic motivation
# - altruism
# - future rewards
# - personal need

# ** Conflict Resolution

# #+begin_notes
# - more than 1 human \Rightarrow conflicts
# #+end_notes

# #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear


# #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
# - resolve quickly to avoid resentment
# - put rules in place
# - get help from a people person!

** Conflicts - One Bad Apple can spoil the Barrel

#+begin_notes
- There *will* be conflicts \Rightarrow resolve to avoid resentment/scaring
- one bad actor can poison your whole community
#+end_notes

# #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
There *will* be conflicts

** Receiving feedback

#+begin_notes
- every feedback valuable: unique insight from different PoV
- but most feedback you'll get is terrible or not proper feedback
- you don't have to address every feedback that you receive
#+end_notes
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- feedback is a gift
- thank, absorb and reflect
- don't defend yourself, adapt and discuss (if appropriate)

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
unfortunately:
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- you will mostly get negative feedback, if *at all*
- *only* negative feedback can be crushing
- must train to not be personally bothered


** Providing feedback

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- criticize the code, not the person
- be constructive, clear and fact oriented
- be positive
- speak only on your behalf

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
a thank you never hurt anyone ❤️


** Proposing Changes

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- start small
- have a vision
- battle versus inertia
- address fears of all stakeholders
- get early adopters and early wins


* So when should I start?
#+begin_notes
- you got one shot at a "public launch" \Rightarrow have a great landing page
#+end_notes

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
*Now*

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
but defer big announcements until it's ready\trade

* This all sounds horrible!

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
It's a lot of fun

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
You will learn a lot

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
But only delve into Open Source as long as it is fun


* So was that all the things they didn't teach me at University?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
Of course not!

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
But it's a starting point for your journey
