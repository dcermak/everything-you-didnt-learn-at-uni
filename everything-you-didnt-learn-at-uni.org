#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) :frag_idx 8
but one thing will *never* change

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) :frag_idx 9
you have to work with *people*


* Working with People in FLOSS

#+begin_notes
- volunteers, paid contributors, students, etc.

transition:
walk through the various aspects of FLOSS & working with the people
#+end_notes

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- their motivation \neq your motivation
- their employer \ne your employer
- their culture \ne your culture
- their timezone \ne your timezone


* How to be a Contributor

#+begin_notes
first tackle the parts that make you a good contributor
#+end_notes

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Think about the *why*
- Say hi üëã
- Start small
- Don't try changing the world (at first)

** Pick the right project

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- pick something where you have a stake
- project must *want* contributions


** Community

#+begin_notes
- community = bunch of people working on a project

- project should make it clear how to contact it & get it touch
  \Rightarrow landing page, have just very few channels and monitor all of them
  if someone joins, you as the maintainer must be made aware of that

- contributors come & go
#+end_notes

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- "just a bunch of people"
- have a common goal
- often no clear joining rules
# - empower others

# - be an enabler and empower your community, don't be a gatekeeper
# - embrace diversity

** How to communicate
#+begin_notes
- keep backgrounds of others in mind
- assume best intentions
#+end_notes

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- asynchronous: @@html: <i class="fa-regular fa-envelope"></i> email, <i class="fa-brands fa-discourse"></i> forums@@

# - *one* place to reach the community

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear

#+end_quote

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)

- be kind to each other

#+REVEAL: split

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
(with exceptions)


* What it means to be a Maintainer

#+begin_notes
- infra: mailinglist/forum, CI, website
#+end_notes

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- you will have to learn to let go & share responsibilities
- take care of all the "boring" parts:
  - infra
  - documentation
  - onboarding & mentoring
  - issue triage & patch reviews
  - funding
  - moderation
- licenses/legal
- project & release management

** Licenses

#+begin_notes
- prescriptive: specific rules about usage
  permissive: "do what you want"
#+end_notes

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
‚ö†Ô∏è IANAL applies ‚ö†Ô∏è

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- prescriptive vs permissive
- attribution?
- copyleft?
- patents?

** How to make your project popular

#+begin_notes
- become the marketing person
- be friendly & welcoming
- be firm in your decisions
#+end_notes

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- build something that people truly need/want
- marketing: talks, tutorials, evangelizing
- documentation, documentation, documentation

** The Contributor Funnel

#+begin_notes
- from Mike McQuaid
- generally how people become maintainers/contributors:
  user \rightarrow contributor \rightarrow maintainer
- more contributors? \Rightarrow get more users!
#+end_notes

** Recruiting contributors
#+begin_notes
- [[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hsJLv1ieSqtXBzd5YZusY-mB8e1VJzaeOmh8Q4VeMio/][study by Mozilla]] about engagement in the community
- you *must* give contributors a vision \rightarrow they'll return even if the past wasn't great
  \rightarrow have features/roadmaps ready, encourage ideas, etc
- onboarding different: past experience highly motivating
- respond within 48h to PR \Rightarrow very high likelihood of returning
- respond later than 7d \Rightarrow you are not seeing them ever again
- suggest another issue to work on
#+end_notes
@@html:<img src="./media/mozilla_impact_study.png" class="fragment appear" data-fragment-index=1></img>@@

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- past impact does *not* matter, perceived future impact *does*
- contributors need a vision
- good onboarding experience encourages further onboarding
- *prompt responses* boost the chances of a contributor returning


** Motivations for contributing
#+begin_notes
Reciprocity ‚Äì duty to give back
Kinship - do it for the community
Own-Use - scratch your own itch

why think about this? \Rightarrow helps understand contributors & "lever to make them do
things"

motivations from https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10291, "fun facts":
- women ~3x more likely out of reciprocity
- coders 4x more likely for fun
- experienced much more likely out of altruism & ideology than non-experienced

change over time:
- own use & ideology \downarrow
- Fun, Kinship, Reciprocity \uparrow (double)
#+end_notes

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. Ideology
2. Altruism
3. Fun
4. Kinship
5. Reputation
6. Reciprocity
7. Learning
8. Own-Use
9. Career
10. Pay


** Staying motivated

#+begin_notes
- intrinsic motivation: desire to code just for fun/hobby
- altruism, including community identification (satisfy need to belong to group)
- future reward: revenue from selling product, skills, self-marketing, peer recognition
- personal need: scratch your own itch

- transition: people do it for others -> build a nice community

# ** Conflict Resolution

# #+begin_notes
# - more than 1 human \Rightarrow conflicts
# #+end_notes

# #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear


# #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
# - resolve quickly to avoid resentment
# - put rules in place
# - get help from a people person!


** Build a welcoming community

#+begin_notes
- codes of conduct are not evil,
  but don't just stick the [[https://www.contributor-covenant.org/][contributor covenant]] on your project and be done with it
  \Rightarrow live by the thing

- provide a place for your community to meet & talk
  \rightarrow nurtures the sense of belonging
  \rightarrow helps *you*, as all communication needn't go through you

- documented rules & processes prevent hair splitting:
  - undocumented rules that are just in a "hive-mind" result in contributors getting frustrated
    \Rightarrow they'll leave soon
  - if there is a conflict, then you can point to the rules
  - even better: enforce rules via code

- empower your contributors:
  - if new people show up, let them take simple issues even if you could solve them in 1/10th of the time
  - share ownership of your project
#+end_notes

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- enforce a code of conduct
- provide *one* place for your community to meet & talk
- document & enforce processes meticulously
- be present and friendly
- empower your contributors

** Conflicts - One Bad Apple can spoil the Barrel

#+begin_notes
- There *will* be conflicts \Rightarrow resolve to avoid resentment/scaring
- one bad actor can poison your whole community
#+end_notes

# #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)

** Rules enforcement & automation

#+begin_notes
- automate what can be automated
- people tend to accept machine enforced rules more than human enforced rules
- careful: cannot solve people problems with technology!

* Take care of yourself

#+begin_notes
- that super duper urgent bug report is not *that* urgent
- you are not in a hurry \rightarrow you *can* take as much time as you need
#+end_notes

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- stay true to yourself & your motivation
- *you* must stay your top priority

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. Learn to say *no*
2. Take it easy and don't take it personally
3. Take it slow


* Feedback

** Receiving feedback

#+begin_notes
- every feedback valuable: unique insight from different PoV
- but most feedback you'll get is terrible or not proper feedback
- you don't have to address every feedback that you receive
#+end_notes
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- feedback is a gift
- thank, absorb and reflect
- don't defend yourself, adapt and discuss (if appropriate)

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
unfortunately:
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- you will mostly get negative feedback, if *at all*
- *only* negative feedback can be crushing
- must train to not be personally bothered


** Providing feedback

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- criticize the code, not the person
- be constructive, clear and fact oriented
- be positive
- speak only on your behalf

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
a thank you never hurt anyone ‚ù§Ô∏è


# * So when should I start?
# #+begin_notes
# - you got one shot at a "public launch" \Rightarrow have a great landing page
# #+end_notes

# #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
# *Now*

# #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
# but defer big announcements until it's ready\trade


* This all sounds horrible!

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
It's a lot of *fun*

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
You will *learn a lot*

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
But only delve into Open Source as long as it is fun


# * So was that all the things they didn't teach me at University?

# #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
# Of course not!

# #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
# But it's a starting point for your journey
